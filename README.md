A web application that was developed as a solution to a coursework project associated with the Programming Black 20/21 module for Computer Science at Durham University.
The assignment was to develop any type of web application in NodeJS that met a set of technical criteria, and where the idea to implement was up to the student.

The web application I decided to build was a hub that provides a modular way of integrating network tools such as nmap and dnsscan in a way that control of tools and their reports
can be centrally viewed and controlled via a GUI or an API.

Here are a few screenshots of the application:
